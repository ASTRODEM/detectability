The scripts in this repository are provided alongside the publication [link_to_publication_once_published], where we investigated whether a medical diagnosis of dementia could be predicted from general practice patient records, and if so, how early. 

The scripts provided in the /code directory where used for patient data cleansing and preprocessing, for generation of feature representations, for model training and evaluation, and for generation of summary plots. Please see the overview file in the /code directory for an assignment of each script to the respective function.
